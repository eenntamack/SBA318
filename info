This is a recipe express application where a user can request whatever recipe they desire, in addition 
to the other Lab assignment for

1. This time there are many more recipes for each request
2. I'm going to utilize the user to change paths depending on the recipe
3. Maybe theres going to be categories dessert, lunches, appetizers, drinks, dinners, etc.
    i. Route structure 
        - index.js
            - Just a main introductory page for the user to start searching for recipes
            - Upon clicking the recipe the user can be prompted a category of recipes
                - each categoy can be given a path 
                    e.g. ("/recipes/categories/:dessert") => shows a list of availible desserts
                - a recipe can be searched by letter in the query
                    e.g. ("/recipes?name=a") => shows a list of recipes by the first letter
4. Middleware?
    i. prompting a successful call for a recipe
        - e.g. app.use("/recipe?name") => if there isnt a recipe that starts with that letter
        log an error and return 404 else next()
            same applies to the other routes
    ii. confirming a download
        i.using the Node fs library to write a file and download for the user
